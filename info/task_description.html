    We have a broken clock; we know how quickly it runs or lags over a certain period of time.
    At first, the clock is set to the correct time, but after a while it begins to display an
    incorrect time...
    But instead to correct clock each time we will use the Algorithm to calculate correct time by
    looking at the wrong time. Of course we will correct time each days so don't worry and
    The etalon and current times fall on the same day. Time is measured in a 24 hour format.
</p>
<p>
    Your are given three values.
    The first is etalon or start correct time.
    The second is current time on the broken clock (wrong).
    Time is given as strings in the format "hh:mm:ss" (Examples: "01:16:59" and "23:00:13").
    The third is a description of the clock error in the format
    <strong>"+(-)N [second, minute, hour](s) at M [second, minute, hour](s)"</strong>.
    For Example "+1 second at 10 seconds" -- the clock is 1 second fast for every 10 seconds
    of the real time period and "-5 minutes at 5 hours" -- the clock lags 5 minutes
    for every 5 hours of actual time.
</p>
<p>
    You should calculate the real time with the given values.
    The result should be rounded down to the nearest second (use floor or int).
</p>
<p>
    Let's examine one example -- '00:00:00', '00:00:30', '+2 seconds at 6 seconds'.<br>
    0th step: The real and fake time is "00:00:00".<br>
    When the real time is "00:00:06", the fake time is "00:00:08".<br>

    At real "00:00:18", fake is "00:00:24".<br>

    At real "00:00:21", fake is "00:00:28".<br>

    At real "00:00:22", fake is "00:00:29.333...".<br>

    At real "00:00:22.5", fake is "00:00:30".<br>

    So answer is "00:00:22.5" after rounding down "00:00:22"
