    <p>“Okay guys. I need some help finding parts for the clock on the bridge.” Nikola told Stephen and Sofia. “It’s
        always reading the wrong time and we really ought to do something about it.”</p>

    <p>“Can’t we just use any old clock?” Stephen asked? “They all tell time the same.”</p>

    <p>“Well, not exactly. The bridge clock is hooked up to the Oddessyus’ main computer. I noticed slight aberrations
        in the day/night cycles and took a look at it. It seems that it is adding or removing different units of time.
        I’m not sure which yet which is why I need your help. Since it is tied to the computer, we can’t just replace
        it, we need to get some parts together to help us recognize and correct differences in time readouts.”</p>

    <p>“Erm, could you explain that in BASIC?” </p>

    <p>“Sigh. The clock is broken, we can’t fix it with a new clock. We need to build a function that will account for
        the discrepancy...” Sofia interjected.</p>

    <p>“Uh, yeah, what she said.” Nikola stammered.</p>

    The Odysseus has a broken clock. We know how quickly it runs or lags over a certain period of time. At first, the
    clock is set to the correct time, but after a while the clock begins to display an incorrect time... Help Nikola to
    determine the correct time. Time is measured in a 24 hour format (1AM is 01:00:00 and 3PM is 15:00:00). The start
    and end time is within the same day. The result is rounded down to the nearest second (use floor or int).

<p><strong>Input:</strong>A list of 3 strings. First string--start time. Second string--end (incorrect) time. Time is
    given in the format "hh:mm:ss" (Examples: "01:16:59" and "23:00:13"). Third string is a description of the clock
    error in the format "+(-)N [second, minute, hour](s) at M [second, minute, hour](s)" (Example: "+1 second at 10
    seconds"--the clock is 1 second fast for every 10 seconds of the real time period and "-5 minutes at 5 hours"--the
    clock lags 5 minutes for every 5 hours of actual time."</p>

<p><strong>Output:</strong>The real time. String in the format "hh:mm:ss." The
    result is rounded down to the nearest second (Example: "00:00:01.9" =
    "00:00:01").</p>

<pre class="brush:python">checkio(['00:00:00', '00:00:15', '+5 seconds at 10 seconds']) ==  '00:00:10'
checkio(['06:10:00', '06:10:15', '-5 seconds at 10 seconds']) ==  '06:10:30'
